This directory contains the start of a LFSC parser for Lean 4.

It should be possible to build by running `make`.  This will
build the program LFSC which expects PLF files to check.

We have a test script `test.sh` that can be run if the
appropriate `plf` files are added to a directory `lfsc_sigs`.
